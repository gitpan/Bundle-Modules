NAME
    Bundle::Modules - All current *stable* bundles of modules in CPAN

SYNOPSIS
    cpanp -i Bundle::Modules ## This installs it

    perl -MBundle::Modules ## This runs it

    NOTE[1]: This is a VERY NEW and DIFFERENT TYPE of bundle, and it's
    completely unlike previously known bundles.

    NOTE[2]: perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Modules' ## This will look like
    an old bundle, and simply loads the Pod's few 'CONTENTS' as listed.

    NOTE[3]: perl -MCPANPLUS -e 'install Bundle::Modules' ## This behaves
    like a new bundle, and actually installs The Bundle::Modules suite.

    NOTE[4]: perl -MBundle::Modules ## This will behave much differently,
    like a 'new type' of bundle should, and installs modules according to
    its Bundle::Modules context.

    NOTE[5]: Please READ this document fully, before criticizing The
    Bundle::Modules suite, something new and much different than what you've
    expected to find in a bundle.

CHANGES
    2006.0510 (YYYY.MMDD)
        Initial version of: Bundle::Modules-2006.0510

        This Bundle::Modules component package is in pre-alpha state with
        hash ordering.

        The ordering of listed modules will eventually be prioritized for
        efficiency and completeness.

        Modules excluded from this module list are either *unstable* or
        *stable* in the Bundle::Modules context.

        Optimistically, if there are a lot of modules excluded, then they
        are *stable*, and we're listing *unstable* context.

        Optimistically, if there are a few of modules excluded, then they
        are *unstable*, and we're listing *stable* context.

    2006.0520
        This contains a newly refined concept of: Bundle::Modules-2006.0520

        This Bundle::Modules component package is in pre-alpha state with
        randomized hash ordering.

        The ordering of listed modules is now shuffled randomly on each run
        for better efficiency and completeness.

        Modules are no longer listed in CONTENTS, like other 'Bundle::'
        bundles out there. I just list a few like Bundle::CPANPLUS.

        I support the idea of testing installations in mass, and I'll use
        the information provided by CPANPLUS test reports.

        The Bundle::Modules suite has *stable* and *unstable* listings that
        will be updated using the information provided by the testers.db

        The Bundle::Modules suite uses Module::Build in its Build.PL, and
        generates a compatible Makefile.PL.

        The Bundle::Modules suite uses the CPANPLUS::Backend to create its
        own random-ordered installations.

    2006.0605
        This now contains a derivative of Test::Reporter, called
        Bundle::Modules::Test::Reporter.

        Bundle::Modules::Test::Reporter sends reports used to create an
        install.db, like the testers.db.

        The install.db will keep track of Installation Security and
        Stability Issues affecting user installations.

              fetch()                   install.db
              extract()                 |        |
              create()                  |        |
              test()         testers.db |        |
              install()                 install.db

        Did the fetch() result with a good CHECKSUM?

        Did the extract() result with a good SIGNATURE and a good MANIFEST?

        Did the create() succeed in order to proceed into testing?

        Did the test() result really deserve the grade('pass') in
        testers.db, or was that FAILED just the user's imagination?

        Did the install() result in the user having succeeded in actually
        getting the distribution, or were we just throwing electron's
        around?

        Basically, I'm trying to capture whatever can be captured, so as to
        characterize the distribution's Security and Stability.

        The Stable bundles will go into Bundle::Modules; and, the Unstable
        bundles will go into Bundle::Modules::Unstable. The Stable modules
        will go into Bundle::Modules::CPAN; and, the Unstable modules will
        go into Bundle::Modules::CPAN::Unstable.

        I'll be focusing large groups of modules out of
        Bundle::Modules::CPAN into Bundle::Modules::Apache, Win32, etc.

        The Stable modules will go into Bundle::Modules::Apache; and, the
        Unstable modules will go into Bundle::Modules::Apache::Unstable. The
        Stable modules will go into Bundle::Modules::Win32; and, the
        Unstable modules will go into Bundle::Modules::Win32::Unstable.

        Since I'm not a Win32 user, I'll depend on the install.db data,
        generated from the automated reports I get from the Win32
        installers.

DESCRIPTION
    This Bundle::Modules component will install all of the modules listed,
    based on the stability/instability context.
